# How the environment can modify conspecific negative density dependence
This repo contains R code used to analyze a large mapped forest plot in the Duke Forest for A. Brown's PhD dissertation.

### R code:
- **curvature** Code to calculate surface curvature of plot topography for use in growth and survival models.
- **mods_growth** R markdown file. Performs model selection for growth models for all spatial scales; tests for spatial autocorrelation; constructs summary tables of parameter estimates of best fit models.
- **mods_survival** R markdown file. Performs model selection for survival models for all spatial scales; tests for spatial autocorrelation; constructs summary tables of parameter estimates of best fit models.
- **plot_results_2020** Code to create 'raw' figures. Some post-processing occurred in Inkscape to create final figures for publication.
- **soil_topography_kriging** Code to perform spatial interpolation on soil data across mapped forest plot.

### Background

**Brown, AJ, PS White, and RK Peet. 2021. Environmental context alters the magnitude of conspecific negativedensity dependence in a temperate forest. *Ecosphere* [available here](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ecs2.3406)**

A central mechanism underlying the maintenance of diversity can be modified by small-scale environmental conditions.
